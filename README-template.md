## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I practiced:

- Using semantic HTML structure
- Applying custom spacing scale with CSS variables (e.g., `--space-50`, `--space-300`)
- Styling hover and focus states on headings
- Creating consistent typography using presets (e.g., `text-preset3-bold`)
- Applying clean box-shadow and border radius for card design

### Continued development

In the future, Iâ€™d like to:

- Add responsiveness for different screen sizes
- Practice accessibility (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA roles)
- Convert this to a reusable component in React or Vue
